Always one pursuit - how do I best express myself though a creative medium. Music composition, photography, text, VR, software engineering, business. Any medium can be learned but fidelity to a lifelong cause can only come from a place of raw honesty.

Essays here are expressions of what I'm seeing. Lately that's tech leadership and social implications of emerging tech.

I regularly unpublish essays I don't like.

I rewrite the codebase for this blog obsessively. This iteration was built with Go. Previous iterations have used the following:

- NextJS
- Hugo
- Hexo
- Raw HTML and CSS (based)
- React, integrating with Ethereum blockchain as a DAPP
- Python/Django/SQLite
- Deno/Fresh

I don't really know why I rebuild this old thing so often but know that I enjoy doing it. Kinda like the mid-life crisis guy working on an old Mustang build that will never be "done".

Spare time? Enjoy coding interesting-to-me projects, reading the Caro books on Lyndon B. Johnson, offroading and camping with the family, shooting (camera or firearms).
