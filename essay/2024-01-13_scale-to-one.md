Some feedback that nobody ever seems to give developers is that your software
idea probably isn't very good. Most of the time it's not only "not very good" it
downright sucks.

Your groundbreaking weather app, _new_ social media platform, or personal
portfolio site is generic and boring. There are thousands of other tools that
solve the problems you are attempting to solve in more creative, efficient, and
useful ways.

Why are you building these things and who are you trying to impress? Does anyone
wake up in the morning passionate and invigorated to build another spreadsheet
editor? Why would you spend your precious time solving such a boring problem?

If you don't have a convincing "why" for the problems you're building to solve
you might succeed and you might even earn a lot of money, but you'll _never_ be
great.

Your why might not be my why but if you embrace your why and risk being a little
weird or even controversial, others with the same why will find you. You won't
even have to search for them. It's some kind of invisible why-magnetism that
brings people that are misshapen in similar ways together.

It starts with you alone though. Take a hard, objective look at the things
you've built lately. Don't ask yourself "Would _someone_ use this?", that
question is for casuals. Ask yourself (honestly), "Am _I_ using this regularly?"

Hypothetical other users don't count, only real ones. Pride has clouded the
judgment of modern engineers. This pride has obfuscated the obvious yet
hard-to-look-at truth: **before you scale to millions you must scale to one.**
