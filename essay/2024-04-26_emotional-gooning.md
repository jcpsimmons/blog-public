Last evening I deleted most of my social media accounts. I had been considering it for a while but I finally snapped this week.

The realization hit me when I was laying on the couch flipping through a short-form video-based social network.

Interacting with the rectangle is emotional gooning. I've been searching for a more civilized way to term it but that's the most fitting and it's appropriate because it's disgusting. You use the rectangle to flip your emotions between extremes, each peak and crest more dramatic than the last, with no conclusion. No real world action is taken that means anything and no meaningful change in lifestyle occurs.

As you flip to videos of horrific human suffering, you feel anger and anxiety, your adrenaline spikes, there is a thrill, you feel guilty about having and noticing the thrill. Just as your anger is flowers into rage and as your anxiety deteriorates into panic a video of a man getting hit in the shins with a scooter appears - you chortle lazily and feel a quick relief - the human suffering video is forgotten and you feel as though everything will be okay. You compulsively flip at a sub-10-second frequency for minutes or hours. You forget what the "middle" feels like. You desensitize yourself to feeling mild happiness and slight disappointment. Everything must now fit into two boxes "best" and "worst". The binary world of the rectangle imposes its fundamental binary structure on your analog reality.

## learn

You flip for days and The Algorithm(TM) learns what you prefer to watch. "I am **learning**" you think. "All of those silly fools that spent years in school to get meaningless degrees, PhDs, MDs, MBAs, JDs aren't so knowledgeable after all, I'm learning all of these things from my rectangle for free!". You fall into delusion. You begin trading stock options. "Sure it's almost a statistical impossibility that I will beat funds comprised of professionals with better inside information than I have, but I'm the exception, I have wisdom from the rectangle, I am an exception to the rule, not like those other cretins!"

You flip some more and see a video by someone with quite a large following saying radical things about modern medicine - their tirade is not in the realm of "healthy skepticism" but attempts to reject medical practices that have been in play for decades. The argument is padded with some "data points" but is primarily an emotional one, e.g. "you're a bad parent and your going to harm or even kill your child if you do this!" You don't want to be a bad parent, this guy has a lot of views and the comments on the video that either vehemently agree with his points or are filled with hate and vitriol. "Wow" you think to yourself "If they're getting this much hate they _must_ be onto something! Now I know the **TRUTH** (TM)! It's incredible to witness a modern Plato suffer for his (undeniably true) contributions to human wisdom!"

I have empathy for falling for these and other delusions. I've personally been under the influence of many of them, they are easy traps to fall into. I assume that I'm still in the snares of many such traps that I can't yet or may never be able to see.

I don't hate social media. Every decision has tradeoffs. There is one social media network that is so measurably valuable for my career that it doesn't make sense to leave it entirely - though I do have mitigation measures in place to prevent me from falling down into the emotional goon trap.

## care

I think I just _can't_ care enough to engage with so many social media networks. I am emotionally exhausted. That's not to say I'm not a caring person. If there were a bell curve of how much people cared I'd be near the middle of it.

I care about a lot of things, many of them unproductive. I have a strong opinion about whichever highly polarizing and divisive story is currently dominating the news cycle (no matter when you read this that statement will remain true). Whenever I "care" about a story in the news, three things _always_ occur: I get emotionally charged, I don't actually know enough to have a nuanced opinion, and my opinion doesn't have any meaningful effect on the real world. At best I approve of whatever is happening and I feel some (unearned) satisfaction in it. At worst I feel angry at the injustice I perceive in the world and the injustice continues unaffected by my tantrum. As far as buckling down and learning enough to form a nuanced opinion? I really only had enough "care" left in the tank to watch a 5 minute video on the topic. Plus, how will I find good information on the internet without wasting my time? It's most probable that I'll just find a 30 minute video by some other asshole who doesn't know what they're talking about - then I'm 35+ minutes in the hole and even less intelligent on the topic.

I still exist, just not on most of the social media networks I used to use. It's not that I don't care how you and the family are doing or where you're traveling this month, it's just that I can't care about it every day and it would be dishonest if I said I could. Could you imagine if we worked in an office together, Monday through Friday, and every morning I asked you "HOW IS YOUR FAMILY DOING - HAVE ANY RECENT PICTURES?" By Thursday you'd want to slam my head in the copier over and over again until the ink ran dry!

I hope that I can redirect most of my creativity towards the blog. Writing an essay is taxing, it takes sustained effort. By the time I've tweeted, posted, and shared a few pics I don't feel like I can care enough to develop a new essay that could take days or weeks to get right. Maybe that can change for the better if I can stop emotionally gooning for long enough to give a damn.
